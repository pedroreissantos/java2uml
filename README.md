  Simple Converters from Java code to uml

  1) java2yuml produces output compatible with htt://yuml.me UML drawing tool
  2) java2umletino produces a text readble form of UML classes.
     The output can then be used to include in UML classes of the umletino
     UML editor. No inheritance or association are processed, but information
     is included in the class header.
